# Skills

**Canon scope:** Canon (highlight shard-specific tweaks as non-canon when needed).

Catalogues each skill, its mechanics, training methods, and notable synergies. Include era changes (pre- and post-publish adjustments) where they alter gameplay.

## What to document
- Skill descriptions, caps, and training breakpoints.
- Special moves, mastery abilities, and item bonuses tied to skills.
- Patch-era differences (e.g., Eval Int damage scaling, barding difficulty changes).

## Cross-linking tips
- Reference formulas or system impacts in [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md).
- Link to gear and crafted tools in [items](../items/README.md) and [crafting](../crafting/README.md).
- Point to shard-specific adjustments in [shards](../shards/README.md).
