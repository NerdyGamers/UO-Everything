# History & Patch Timeline

**Canon scope:** Canon for official releases; mark shard-specific timelines or recollections as non-canon.

Tracks releases, publishes, and mechanical overhauls across Ultima Online. Helps readers place changes in context and correlate them with lore or economy shifts.

## What to document
- Expansion and publish timelines with notable mechanics changes.
- Economy-impacting events (duplication fixes, loot overhauls, new resources).
- Major world events tied to releases (e.g., Blackrock crises, invasions).

## Cross-linking tips
- Point to lore developments in [lore](../lore/README.md).
- Connect system changes to [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md), [skills](../skills/README.md), and [items](../items/README.md).
- Note shard-specific divergences in [shards](../shards/README.md) with dates.
