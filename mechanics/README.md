# Mechanics

**Canon scope:** Canon (note any shard deviations as non-canon).

Explains how core systems work across expansions: combat math, stats, skills interplay, resistances, fame/karma, and travel rules.

## What to document
- Combat resolution, damage types, resist caps, and PvP/PvE rule differences.
- Stat systems, regeneration, and caps across eras.
- Fame, karma, murder counts, and criminal actions.
- Transportation: moongates, runebooks, recall/gate, and facet restrictions.

## Cross-linking tips
- Point to skill-specific formulas in [skills](../skills/README.md).
- Note equipment impacts and resist interactions in [items](../items/README.md).
- Call out housing-related placement and decay rules in [housing](../housing/README.md).
