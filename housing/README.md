# Housing & Decoration

**Canon scope:** Canon (mark shard-specific placement rules or custom deco systems as non-canon).

Details plot placement, customization rules, storage limits, lockdown/secure mechanics, and decay. Include decorating tools, add-ons, and rare furnishings.

## What to document
- Placement rules, facet restrictions, classic vs. customizable plots.
- Storage math, moving crates, and house security roles.
- Decay timers, IDOCs, and demolition/transfer steps.
- Decorative systems: gozas, add-ons, holiday gifts, and reward items.

## Cross-linking tips
- Tie ownership rules to criminal/recall systems in [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md).
- Connect craftable furnishings to [crafting](../crafting/README.md).
- Reference market trends or IDOC eras in [history](../history/README.md).
