# Quests & Activities

**Canon scope:** Mixed (official quests are canon; player-made events or shard scripts should be labeled non-canon).

Tracks PvM/PvP activities, questlines, champion spawns, and dungeon runs. Highlight requirements, rewards, and how mechanics or lore tie into encounters.

## What to document
- Quest chains, key NPCs, requirements, and branching outcomes.
- Dungeon overviews, boss mechanics, and loot expectations.
- Champ spawns, peerless fights, treasure maps, and SOS fishing.

## Cross-linking tips
- Link lore hooks back to [lore](../lore/README.md).
- Reference mechanical nuances (slayers, resist checks) from [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md) and [skills](../skills/README.md).
- Point to reward items in [items](../items/README.md) and [crafting](../crafting/README.md).
