# Shards & Rulesets

**Canon scope:** Mixed (official production shards are canon; player-run shards and custom rulesets are non-canon and should be labeled).

Documents official shard histories, server rules, and player-run shards. Capture ruleset divergences, custom content, and timelines for major resets or merges.

## What to document
- Official shard specifics (Felucca/Trammel split, Siege/ Mugen rules, seasonal shards).
- Player-run shards, their custom systems, and community notes.
- Event shards or limited-time servers with unique mechanics.

## Cross-linking tips
- Link mechanics differences back to [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md) and [skills](../skills/README.md).
- Reference custom items or drops in [items](../items/README.md).
- Connect lore variations to [lore](../lore/README.md) with clear canon labels.
