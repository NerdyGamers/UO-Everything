# World & Locations

**Canon scope:** Canon (note non-canon shards or custom maps explicitly).

Maps facets, cities, dungeons, wilderness points of interest, and travel networks. Capture regional quirks, spawn tables, and lore hooks tied to geography.

## What to document
- Facet overviews (Felucca/Trammel, Ilshenar, Malas, Tokuno, Ter Mur).
- City guides: services, faction control points, and guard rules.
- Dungeon layouts, key spawns, and environmental hazards.
- Transportation nodes: moongates, boat routes, teleporter hubs.

## Cross-linking tips
- Connect narrative context to [lore](../lore/README.md).
- Note encounter details for [quests](../quests/README.md) and rule variations in [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md).
- Document shard-specific geography tweaks in [shards](../shards/README.md).
