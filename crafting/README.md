# Crafting & Trade Skills

**Canon scope:** Canon (flag custom shard recipes or drop tables as non-canon).

Covers production skills, resource cycles, crafting tools, and vendor economics. Emphasize patch-level changes that altered supply, durability, and success rates.

## What to document
- Recipes, material tiers, and success/exceptional chance math.
- Runic tools, powder-of-fortifying, imbuing, reforging, and enhancement rules.
- Resource gathering (mining, lumberjacking, fishing) and rare material locations.
- Player vendors, commodity deeds, and bulk order deeds (BODs).

## Cross-linking tips
- Link finished goods and properties to [items](../items/README.md).
- Surface skill dependencies with [skills](../skills/README.md).
- Note economic impacts alongside [history](../history/README.md) when market shifts occur.
