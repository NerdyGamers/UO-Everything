# UO-Everything

UO-Everything is a living wiki-style repository that captures knowledge about **Ultima Online**—including both canon and non-canon material. The goal is to make it easy to find lore, mechanics, player-driven history, and creative community content in one place.

## How this repository is organized
- **Canon references:** Official lore, in-game systems, maps, and mechanics from Origin/EA/Mythic/Broadsword releases.
- **Non-canon additions:** Community interpretations, shards, fan fiction, house rules, and speculative timelines. Clearly label non-canon content so readers can distinguish it from primary sources.
- **Topic folders:** Add subdirectories when a topic grows (e.g., `lore/`, `mechanics/`, `shards/`, `community/`, `artifacts/`). Use concise README files in each folder to link related documents.
- **Cross-linking:** Add links between related documents to mirror a wiki experience. Prefer relative links so navigation works in any viewer.

## Writing guidelines
- **Source transparency:** Note where information comes from (e.g., in-game patch notes, official guides, fan recollections). When citing community memories, say so explicitly.
- **Neutral voice:** Document facts and observations without editorializing. If perspectives differ, include each viewpoint with attribution.
- **Version awareness:** Ultima Online changed over time; specify era (e.g., T2A, Renaissance, Age of Shadows, Mondain’s Legacy, Kingdom Reborn, Stygian Abyss, etc.).
- **Spoiler awareness:** Flag story spoilers near the top of files when applicable.
- **Accessibility:** Use headings, bullet lists, and tables of contents for longer documents. Keep sentences clear for new and returning players.

## Contribution workflow
1. **Add or update documents** in the appropriate folder. Create a new folder when a topic needs its own space and add a README to outline the contents.
2. **Differentiate canon vs. non-canon** at the top of each document. Include dates/eras and shard names when relevant.
3. **Cite sources** in-line (links, publication dates, shard forums, or patch notes) whenever possible.
4. **Summaries first:** Start long documents with a short summary or overview to help readers decide if they should keep reading.
5. **Link outward:** When official or community references exist elsewhere, link to them rather than duplicating large passages.
6. **Review changes:** For documentation-only changes, tests are not required; for code changes, run the relevant linters and tests before committing.

## Getting started
- Clone the repo and browse existing folders to see topic coverage.
- Create focused markdown files for new lore entries, mechanics explanations, shard rulesets, or player history.
- Use pull requests to discuss structure, naming, and canonical labeling as the repository grows.

## Future directions
- Establish templates for frequently documented topics (quests, dungeons, skills, shard rulesets).
- Build an index file that links major topics for newcomers.
- Add timelines that track patch-era changes to mechanics and lore.
- Gather community shard spotlights and interviews to preserve history.
