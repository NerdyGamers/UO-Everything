# Items & Equipment

**Canon scope:** Mixed (core gear is canon; shard-only items or custom artifacts should be labeled non-canon).

Outlines weapons, armor, consumables, artifacts, and magic properties. Note how itemization changed across expansions (durability, resist spreads, loot tables, intensity caps).

## What to document
- Weapon/armor categories, properties, and durability rules.
- Artifact lists, set bonuses, and acquisition sources.
- Consumables (potions, scrolls, reagents) and resource requirements.
- Loot systems, rarity tiers, and intensity rules by era.

## Cross-linking tips
- Connect crafting ingredients and recipes to [crafting](../crafting/README.md).
- Reference combat or resist impacts in [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md).
- Link shard-specific drops or custom sets from [shards](../shards/README.md).
