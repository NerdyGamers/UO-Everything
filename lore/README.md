# Lore

**Canon scope:** Mixed (canon narratives from official releases; non-canon player fiction or shard-specific retellings should be labeled).

Briefs origin stories, NPC factions, deities, and major plot arcs across eras. Keep timelines clear so readers can place events in their release context.

## What to document
- Era-specific storylines (e.g., T2A serpent ruins, Age of Shadows upheaval, Stygian Abyss myths).
- Notable characters, factions, and conflict summaries.
- In-game books, quests with narrative weight, and lore crumbs from towns or dungeons.

## Cross-linking tips
- Reference related timelines in [history](../history/README.md).
- Connect quest-specific lore to the activity notes in [quests](../quests/README.md).
- Link to shard interpretations inside [shards](../shards/README.md) when narratives diverge.
