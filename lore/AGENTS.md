# Agent Instructions for `lore/`

These instructions apply only to the `lore/` directory and its subdirectories.

## Purpose
- Keep this directory focused on in-world narrative references organized by release era.
- Structural changes (new folders, renames) should happen **only when necessary** to maintain a clear timeline or resolve conflicts.

## Era directories
- Use numbered prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) to keep eras ordered chronologically.
- Each era folder must include a concise `README.md` that lists key themes, canon/non-canon sources, and links to deeper lore pages.
- When adding new eras, increment the prefix and maintain consistent kebab-case names after the number.

## Writing guidelines
- Follow the root repository instructions: label content as **Canon** or **Non-Canon** near the top of each document and favor neutral, sourced summaries.
- Cross-link to related timelines in `history/` and shard-specific variations in `shards/` when helpful.

## Change discipline
- Avoid unnecessary edits; prefer targeted updates aligned with new lore additions or restructuring needs.
- If multiple perspectives exist, capture them with attribution instead of removing prior versions.
