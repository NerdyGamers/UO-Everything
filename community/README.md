# Community & History

**Canon scope:** Non-canon leaning (player accounts and shard culture); call out when referencing official announcements or patch notes.

Captures guild spotlights, player-run events, PvP tournament records, roleplay communities, and notable housing or market hubs.

## What to document
- Guild histories, alliances, and rivalries with dates/eras.
- Player-run events (auctions, festivals, PvP leagues) and their rule sets.
- Market hubs, trade forums, and community tools.
- Interview summaries and oral histories.

## Cross-linking tips
- Link related mechanics or shard rules to [shards](../shards/README.md) and [mechanics](../mechanics/README.md).
- Tie lore-aligned roleplay to references in [lore](../lore/README.md).
- Reference notable housing builds in [housing](../housing/README.md).
